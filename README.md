# OdooFromNET
Development of a .NET desktop application for partner management in Odoo using XML-RPC. (PoC)
The term CRUD represents the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a management system: Create , Read , Update , Delete . These are the fundamental operations in any system that manages data, and are essential for maintaining and manipulating information in any database or storage system.

In this project, we implement a CRUD system for partner management in Odoo using a VB.NET application , where the following operations can be performed:

Create new partners.
Read (load) the list of existing partners.
Update the information of a selected partner.
Remove an existing partner from the database.

Technologies used
This project combines several technologies and techniques that enable interaction between VB.NET desktop application and Odoo system:

VB.NET : Programming language used to develop the desktop application that will manage the partners, the project is in Winforms.
XML-RPC : Protocol that allows remote communication between systems. Through XML-RPC, the VB.NET application communicates with Odoo to perform CRUD operations in real time. XML-RPC sends requests and receives responses in XML format.
Odoo : The ERP system where partner data is stored and managed.
EPPlus : .NET library used to export data to Excel files (.xlsx).
Windows Forms : Graphical platform for creating user interfaces in Windows desktop applications.
